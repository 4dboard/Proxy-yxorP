Files (Flat-File) are used to hold the information created by the plug-and-play application yxorP. Since they are not
necessary, Composer, PHP CURL, and databases are optional for the execution of this application. yxorP was created to
function as a proxy and is capable of altering the contents of several websites. This was the original aim behind its
creation. The Admin, the system's principal backend, controls this component (GUI).

It is common knowledge that yxorP is one of the web proxy systems that, compared to other web proxy systems now
available on the market, enables users to tailor their surfing experience in the most ways. yxorP is among the most
flexible web proxy solutions in terms of browsing capabilities. Moreover, yxorP is one of the first web proxy systems
ever created. This is due to its event-driven architecture and emphasis on its plugin-based design, rather than its
built-in features, which are the most essential and defining components that enable customization and extension of its
capabilities. Due to its versatility and scalability, this is the case.

Because they provide customization and expansion of a product's capabilities, the built-in features are the most
distinguishing and significant aspects. This is due to its adaptable and expandable qualities, which has led to the
current circumstance. This is due to the fact that the inherent characteristics are the most fundamental and distinctive
characteristics, allowing for the change and expansion of its capabilities. This is the reason behind the present
situation. In addition to a graphical user interface (GUI) and a back-end content management system (CMS), yxorP has a
number of additional distinguishing features. These qualities include a number of additional characteristics that
separate it in a variety of ways from its competitors. These distinctive characteristics, such as the product's quality,
set it apart from its rivals.

Currently, the hostname of the request being processed is utilized to search the backend for website-specific
requirements. Then, using these criteria, the best website is selected and any required revisions are made. The user may
spin the website's content using the pre-integrated article-spinning engine of the application. The user has access to
this option. This activity is undertaken in accordance with the user's preferences. Flat-file caching solutions are
about 500 times faster than memory-based caching systems such as Memcache or Redis. This is accomplished by reducing the
overall number of serialization and deserialization operations, which results in a cache that operates much faster.

Due to a recent update, the most thorough version of yxorP may now be examined by the BugSnag error reporting and
warning system. Recent adjustments have been made. This function was designed to determine whether Snag is compatible
with a previously issued update. Changing the default logging system might take as little as two minutes due to the
program's interoperability with the great majority of industry-standard error tracking solutions. This is the situation
due to the interoperability capabilities of the bulk of these systems. This conclusion was attainable due to the
software's capacity to monitor the system and report any vulnerabilities it detects.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/174922574-d5a246b5-c30e-4a63-bc22-4957184feef9.png)

yxorP was developed from the ground up with compatibility with both stateless and stateful servers, such as Apache (like
IIS). It is compatible with TCP, UDP, Unix socket, HTTP, and Websocket and facilitates the development of concurrent
services that are both rapid and scalable (* Parallel *). It is also compatible with each of these protocols. In
addition, it is compatible with each of these protocols without issue. (Swoole). The term "high-performance" is used to
describe both of these servers, which are networking frameworks. These two servers are under the category of networking
frameworks. According to the description, each of these servers is designed with "event-driven, asynchronous, and
non-blocking I/O." This is evident from the description.

![img.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/157201823-d408f32b-44e7-4cd5-bd5f-6e14ac741b93.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/179233034-8e2e3fa1-9c10-4e7b-9a26-34037073fd0d.png)

PHP, unlike other programming languages, is by default staeless much like HTML or CSS. This aspect of the protocol is
reminiscent of the first stages of the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) (HTTP). Sstate can be implemented however
using sessions, databases, shared memory, files, or any other technology that is capable of keeping state in some
capacity in some form or another.

A typlical setup for this type of PHP application would be using Apache or for example Nginx with php-fpm. NGINX web
server (as reverse proxy) serves PHP applications through the FastCGI protocol (as a backend application server). NGINX
employs PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager), an alternative PHP FastCGI implementation that runs in the background as a
daemon, listening for CGI requests i.e.

``` 

server {

        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;
       
        listen 443 ssl default_server;
        listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;
        
        error_log /var/www/yxorP/logs;
        
        root /var/www/yxorP;

        index index.php;

        server_name _;

        location ~ / {
                if (!-e $request_filename){
                        rewrite ^.* /index.php break;
                }
                include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf; fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
        }

}


```

Both the Swoole and the RoadRunner servers, which are well-known for their speed and dependability, are capable of
running PHP applications. These programs must have access to persistent data. After installation, the Swoole PHP
extension gives users access to a wide number of functions, some of which may be useful while others may be entertaining
to explore. This spans a wide range of concepts, including web sockets, coroutines, fibers, and caching. The creation of
RoadRunner, which is a robust application server, load balancer, and process manager, was accomplished with the
assistance of GoLang. It is possible that Octane will implement any one of these strategies; it all relies on the person
who created the code. As a result of Octane's usage of the PHP Swoole extension, the latter has access to a far greater
number and diversity of functions than RoadRunner has.

``` 

php ./server.php

```

Docker Compose is a tool that enables developers to build and deploy applications that are comprised of several
containers at the same time. You are free to create and launch apps with the assistance of this tool. Compose gives us
the ability to declare our services inside of a YAML file, which afterwards gives us the ability to deploy, expand, or
destroy our infrastructure with a single command.

``` 

docker-composer up -d 

```

![img.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/157201823-d408f32b-44e7-4cd5-bd5f-6e14ac741b93.png)

Docker gives its customers the capacity to manage containers in a way that is comparable to managing virtual machines.
This is due to the fact that containerized computers are comparable to virtual machines in that they are comparatively
lightweight and modular. This makes it feasible to simplify a range of processes, including the design and construction
of containers as well as the transportation of images. One example of this is the shipping of photographs. Voici a few
illustrations of some of these:

```

docker run

-p 80:80 --rm -u www-data -v \`pwd\`:/var/www -e ENV=dev donpablonow/yxorp 

```

> ⚠️Requires: Minimum requirement is PHP version 8.0 +

Create a duplicate of the  "example.env" file and save it as ".env"

```

cp ./example.env ./.env 

```

Modify the settings included inside the ".env" file as necessary. The program is configured to respond to queries from
any domain by acting as a proxy and forwarding them to the "example.com" website. Replace "www.example.com" in the.env
file with a new URL, and all future queries will reflect the change. After serving the website on localhost or any other
domain, go to http://localhost/admin and enter the login yxorP and the password you established. In addition, you may
use the credentials provided in the '.env' file. This will allow you to configure the application to direct traffic from
a given domain to a specific website. After gaining access to the admin, choose "sites" and clone the example website so
that its settings may be modified.

After cloning the repository, you need to pull the Cockpit submodule as well, like this:

```bash

  //Clone the repository
  git clone https://github.com/4dboard/proxy-yxorp
  
  //Pull the Cockpit submodule  
  git submodule init
  
  //If still not working you can try this:
  git submodule add  https://github.com/agentejo/cockpit app/lib/cockpit

  
```

## Technical Issue and Assistance

### The program is "plug and play" and works properly out of the box; the following issues have been noted with the application could be:

- Verify that the computer has been outfitted with all of the necessary PHP extensions, such as the following:

    - PHP Pdo mod, and this is for the sqlite database 'apt install php8.1-common'
    - PHP Intl mod, this is for puny domain names, Punycode or IDN, or install it with 'php-intl' if you want to use it
      with IDN.

- You need to check that the "./app/lib/cockpit" submodule was properly retrieved; the directory should already be
  present at the top level of the project and have some information. If the directory is not there, you may quickly
  initialize the submodule by entering "git submodule init" into the terminal.

- Ensure that the x cache folders that can be found in "./app/lib/cockpit/storage/tmp" and "./inc/tmp." are able to have
  their contents written to. Either the command "chmod 775./app/lib/cockpit/storage/tmp" or the command "chown root:
  ./cockpit/storage/tmp" may be used to make the files readable again.

If you have completed all of these steps, you should be experiencing no difficulty.

However if you are still experiencing problems, you will likely need to contact a developer or file a request for help
on github's issue tracker for this project.

### 🔋 Batteries Included: Plug & Play \[CURL + Composer Optional\], Proxy as a Service, Multi-tenant, Multi-Threaded, with Cache & Article Spinner.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/178638238-d67683cc-00bf-47ab-b4d1-b0fe2edc0a6d.png)

In addition to a system for content-spinning and an auto-caching engine, the website's interface is visually pleasant.
Arangodb, Devnull, Dynamodb (AWS), Cassandra, Devrandom, Files, CouchBasev3, Memstatic, Firestore, Couchdb, Leveldb,
Mongodb, Memcache(d),Predis, Sqlite, Redis, Wincache, Sssb, and Zend Disk Cache are among the available cache drivers.
Integrating the two most efficient web proxy applications enhances performance. This self-service proxy engine supports
several tenants with little performance loss by combining an attractive flat-file web interface with a bespoke
multi-threaded caching layer and a very effective thesaurus article spinner with a minimum vocabulary of 10,000 words.
In addition to an integrated cache management system and a web-based cache management system, the proxy is modular or
plugin-based. Internet-based graphical user interface (GUI) monitoring and analytics (GUI). By using a custom-built
content spinning engine, the system is able to "enhance" (or "spin") information with little performance loss (10,000+
thesaurus/dictionary items) and without sacrificing quality.

### If you want a versatile management interface that isn't flexible and replaceable, the admin back-end is fantastic.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/179237020-fda021a1-5554-4fc6-8f28-5f09d3d5cb19.png)

Implementation is the most efficient approach to use the offered information. Admin is a good option to investigate if
you need to manage a large number of devices or require a content management interface for static site builders. Both of
these scenarios need cautious admin operation. If any of these apply to your situation, you should give them special
consideration. Each of these occurrences happens sometimes. Construct whole new apps, then provide Admin access to them
so it can feed them content.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/174488292-66e75484-d57b-472f-8921-661d09387727.png)

The headless admin is displayed with an API-first layout that prioritizes and hierarchically arranges data. This
separation between client-side consumption and management of information and server-side administration of material
should simplify the publishing process. The admin is limited to the tasks required to maintain back-end content. Its
fundamental objective is to distribute structured content across several media via a simple application programming
interface, as opposed to depending on the transmission of data through individual web pages.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/174488463-767e2f7a-8409-445b-b7e8-ed45d0965a89.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/179238514-b5df4a1f-a5cd-44d8-a3a5-fa59a2d5b34c.png)

## Key features:

Manage flexible content models. Despite the existence of accessible content models, none have been developed before. You
will be solely responsible for developing the content model required for this method. A user interface free of
extraneous elements and clutter. Admin provides not just an easy user interface, but also one that is continuously
updated.

You may use the system in any way you see appropriate, so long as you adhere to the set requirements. There is just one
system in place. Utilize a straightforward application programming interface to get access to your content (
API).

#### The Advantages Of Going Headless

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/178638648-57afc681-e222-4401-a1c6-a6c8812dd624.png)

- You are free to come up with the most creative arrangement you are capable of conceiving since the display does not
  have any restrictions of any kind, giving you the opportunity to do so.

- As a consequence of the potential to make content just once and then use it across the board, it is possible to
  produce material for a substantial number of various distribution channels at the same time. These channels include
  television, radio, the internet, and mobile devices.

- Content that can be easily resized to suit numerous screen sizes without suffering a degradation in quality and that
  can be rapidly changed to match a number of screen sizes

- Capable of functioning appropriately on all of the various devices that you use, in addition to the microsites, in the
  event that you make use of them.

- The basic minimal amount of knowledge and experience that is necessary to be considered qualified for the position

- Incorporations that are not just fast, but they are also simple and straightforward to comprehend

- Creating effective lines of communication with every facet of life is an imperative need that must be met.

You may build static flat file versions of your original webpages by utilizing yxorP to mirror your websites, supplying
mirrored or cloned copies of those websites, and then giving the mirrored or cloned copies of those websites as static
flat file variants of your original webpages. This is feasible by using yxorP to mirror your websites.

![img.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/157201823-d408f32b-44e7-4cd5-bd5f-6e14ac741b93.png)

# 🔥 Cache

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/179238649-d6a11606-e6b2-4137-b67c-332497969087.png)

The cached information is made accessible to customers through a Web proxy. These items may include anything that is
available through the Internet. This category may include articles, images, and files. Internet users may now get the
required information far faster, and they are no longer directly in competition with other activities for available
bandwidth.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/178638714-b7a75c9d-eec0-4831-aced-45a3da6424a2.png)

When you load your websites utilizing caching, you not only reduce the likelihood that the loading time will increase,
but you also reduce the server strain caused by your actions. Consequently, the time required for online pages to load
will decrease with time.

![img.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/157201823-d408f32b-44e7-4cd5-bd5f-6e14ac741b93.png)

# 📛 Firewall

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/179238707-e5082057-6373-4ccf-8cff-7a2b3acb8799.png)

All network access requests are continually monitored and filtered by a firewall, while proxy servers only provide the
former role. This is the most significant distinction between the two security techniques. This is the most notable
distinction between the two kinds of used safety measures. By emphasizing this contrast, the two unique types of
security measures may be distinguished most clearly from one another.

A proxy server connects the user's local computer to the server, allowing it to receive data on the user's behalf. This
connection gives the local computer of the user access to the server. Due to these operations, the proxy server acts as
an intermediate between the client and the server. Access should never be allowed unless specifically permitted by the
appropriate authorities.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/178638799-eed7c7ae-0bc6-4fc8-9403-68caf71d182b.png)

To defend your websites against distributed denial of service attacks and other sorts of attacks, you must configure a
virtual firewall behind your proxy server. You will be safeguarded against website-based assaults in general if you
follow these steps to their logical conclusion.

![img.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/157201823-d408f32b-44e7-4cd5-bd5f-6e14ac741b93.png)

The CORS Proxy API will use many backend technologies to fulfill all of your requests for third-party-controlled
resources. This is required for the API to fulfill your requests. The sole requirement of the CORS Proxy API endpoint is
that you provide the request body together with all client-requested request data. After receiving and processing your
request, CORS Proxy will promptly return it to you using an efficient and effective method.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6468571/178638893-c3dd1cef-48ae-490e-b80c-66b1eeb84b99.png)

Although it is feasible to use iframing services without CORS, doing so is discouraged. It has been said that the
behavior in question, although being plausible and "not suggested but attainable," it is "not advised but possible."

# 🔱 Load-balancing

TCP Proxy Load Balancing is a method that allows users from many regions of the world to share a single IP address. The
TCP proxy load balancer is accountable for automatically routing traffic to the geographically nearest backends. TCP
Proxy Load Balancing may operate as a global load balancing service when the Premium Tier is applied. Either a load
balancer or a Web proxy server is required when implementing in-memory replication of client session information. Both
options cannot be used together. This is done so that all domain-based applications may be accessed through a single URL
for external clients.

The installation of cloned copies of your website on several additional servers, each of which is connected to a
load-balancing system, is one method for achieving this objective. There are several other approaches that might
possibly be used in this operation. Using a cluster of servers is a potential alternative method that might be utilized
to execute this assignment effectively.

It is possible to provide failover support across proxies by duplicating the first proxy server. This second proxy
server is very identical to the first. This permits a smooth transfer between proxy servers in the case of a server
failure. Due to their incapacity to communicate, proxy servers and peer masters must be handled by a load balancer since
they are unaware of one another. Peer masters are in communication with and converse with one another. In contrast, peer
masters are familiar with one another and maintain open communication lines. Various properties of peer masters and
proxy servers must be accounted for.

By keeping a proxy version of your website and switching to it whenever the actual website is unavailable for
maintenance or changes, you can ensure that your online resources remain accessible at a high level and continuously.
This will guarantee that your online material is constantly accessible to users. This will help you to guarantee that
your consumers always have access to your online resources.

Because our mobile support is widely regarded as the industry's gold standard, we are able to supply teams with
diagnostic data that enables them to reproduce issues and discover solutions to them as soon as those problems begin to
have an effect on the system's reliability. The reports on the different types of errors are sorted according to the
underlying cause of the error, and in some situations, they are also categorized according to the impact that the error
had on the business. In addition to this, we provide our clients with in-depth information on the diagnostic process.

Gitpod gives Theia developers access to a Visual Studio Code-based integrated development environment (IDE). This
integrated development environment (IDE) allows the change and reorganization of code, as well as the creation of
brand-new features. It offers a full operating system environment, allowing programs designed expressly for the platform
to use the operating system environment and run effectively. This is possible because these apps may misuse the
operating system environment. As a result, apps may now use the operating system environment. Previously, this was
impossible. During the creation of these apps, the extensive capabilities of the platform were meticulously evaluated.

Visit their website to learn more about Gitpod and how the platform's capabilities are always expanding. These two
topics are discussed on their website. Gitpods, on the other hand, are containers managed by Docker and running Ubuntu
20.04 Focal Focal. The software installation process is hindered because the user gitpod is not on the list of users
having sudo privileges. This raises the procedure's complexity. It is not impossible for installation components that
need root privileges to alter the Dockerfile associated with a running instance of Docker. The optimum place for various
activities may be the Dockerfile, the command line, or the code, depending on the circumstances of the situation. As
Dockerfiles are only configuration files for containers, they do not need to be very complicated for the vast majority
of operations.

Gitpod has a user account and home directory named gitpod and located at /home/gitpod. Despite this, only the original
Docker container is preserved in the shared and shareable workspace. When a repository is cloned or rolled back, only
the modifications performed in the workspace of a Gitpod are kept. "workspace" refers to the directory structure
available through the route /workspace/your-workspace-name, and "workspace" refers to the directory structure.

The performance of a single web proxy surpasses that of the two original web proxies combined. Due to the combination of
two of the most powerful PHP reverse proxies presently available on the Internet, this is now feasible. Combining two
PHP reverse proxies resulted in the creation of this web proxy. Due to the fact that this is a brand-new project, it may
be modified in the future. Your cooperation and understanding are much appreciated in this subject. You just cannot
ignore this part of the issue. Using the PHP-Proxy library, which is a component of the PHP programming language and can
be downloaded for free from the PHP website, you may quickly and easily configure a web proxy application for your web
server. Visit their website if you are interested in learning more about PHP. Thus, you may avoid manually setting the
web proxy application you use. If you are able to help financially or in any other way to the success of this project,
please know that you will be shown a great degree of gratitude and will not be acting alone. I could devote more time to
the growth and development of the project, therefore accelerating its overall advancement.

Server Keep in mind that the operation of this proxy script may be compromised on websites or pages that, as mentioned
above, include an excessive number of "dynamic components" or are otherwise script-heavy. This is something that must be
recalled continually. This is an essential factor that must constantly be kept in mind. It is essential that you always
have this in mind, thus keep it in mind at all times. Web proxy transmissions cannot be encrypted, which is a
shortcoming of the technology. This topic is well recognized. This problem has persisted for a period of time that is
deemed substantial. This is only one of the several unfavorable facets of the present situation. Visiting certain types
of websites may need the usage of a dependable proxy server to guarantee that your web browser's HTTP requests are
routed via the proper websites. To preserve the privacy of the information you enter on the websites you visit, this
will be the case. This is done to guarantee that your privacy and safety are always maintained.

When it comes to software updates, the alterations that are made are most likely going to be made to the application's
dependant packages rather than the program itself; for instance, the bulk of the modifications are going to be made to
the php-proxy package rather than to the program itself.

#### .env

This file will be loaded into the Config /\*\* \* {@inlinetag} \* this is @not a standardtag - must begin a line. \*
this is a valid {@inlinetag} also \* @standardtag \*/ class at the global level.

#### /plugins/

Users are strongly encouraged to create their own plugins in this subdirectory, which may be loaded automatically from
the root directory. This subfolder is located inside the root directory, which contains all other subfolders. In
addition, these plugins may be manually installed on the system. The proxy, which includes a number of built-in plugins,
has some limits, and users are strongly encouraged to create their own plugins to maximize the number of available
customization choices. This is due to the proxy's incorporation of several plugins. This is because the proxy has
already installed several plugins. This is because the proxy's design already contains several plugins. Multiple plugins
have been preconfigured on the proxy server for your convenience. Consider a simple example, such as the "
/plugins/TestPlugin.php" text file. This file may be located in the plugins directory and is positioned inside it.

Utilize your web browser to go to the root directory of the project. The next step is account registration, followed by
login. yxorP is Composer-compatible and supports databases, PHP, and CURL. Given that yxorP is operating as their proxy,
alterations are permissible. Admin controls the PHAR (PHP archive) binary version of proxies, which is used by many
websites. The yxorP web proxy, which permits user experience customisation, is commercially available and deployable.
However, a plugin-based architecture and event-driven design are required. Expandable, customisable. YxorP offers the
industry's most potent graphical back-end content management system interface. When a request is made, the hostname will
be utilized to get site-specific information from the system's backend. modified. Occasionally, specialized engines are
used to recreate website content. Any adjustments you make to the page are automatically saved. The memory-based cache
is about 500 times more efficient than the flat-file cache. Memcache and Redis are both caching technologies. Avoiding
serialization may increase the efficiency of cache processing. After receiving a software upgrade, Snag will soon be
able to handle yxorP. This problem has been resolved, therefore the upgrading may continue without incident. Due to the
application's interoperability with other systems and error tracking, the logging must be adjusted.

Before pull requests may be sent to the production environment, they must be reviewed and approved by the development
team. This must be completed prior to implementing any pull requests. This need must be met before pull requests may be
implemented, since it is a prerequisite. To debate the suggested modifications to the document, you must create a new
issue with the title of the primary discussion subject. Then, and only then, may you specify the modifications you want
to implement. Then you may negotiate the required revisions. Then you will be able to accomplish the essential life
changes. After that, you will finally be able to discuss the desired life enhancements. Please ensure that all tests are
up-to-date so the results may be interpreted as precisely as possible. We cannot adequately convey our appreciation for
your assistance and support. We are really appreciative. Please accept our profound gratitude for all you've done for
us.
