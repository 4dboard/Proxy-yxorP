Convenient features such as built-in content spinning and an auto caching engine are hidden behind a slick online interface. Among the cache drivers provided are Arangodb, Devnull, Dynamodb (AWS), Cassandra, Devrandom, Files, CouchBasev3, Memstatic, Firestore, Couchdb, Leveldb, Mongodb, Memcache(d),Predis, Sqlite, Redis, Wincache, Ssdb, and Zend Disk Cache.

The combined might of two of the most successful web proxy initiatives is harnessed for maximum effect. This self-service proxy engine has zero performance loss and supports numerous tenants by combining a flat-file beautiful web interface with a custom multi-threaded caching layer and an extremely powerful 10,000+ word thesaurus article spinner. Vanilla Dashboard is a no-cost, no-commitment self-service proxy engine that supports numerous tenants. Specifically, the project is looking for funding to help tie off some loose ends, particularly with the backed GUI; the front-end is complete and functional, but code cleanup and unit testing are required.

yxorp (proxy.) is a one-of-a-kind, plug-and-play (no installation required), multi-threaded, website mirroring and content augmentation, fast cache, and multi-web proxy server that performs website mirroring and content augmentation, website mirroring and content augmentation, fast cache, and multi-web proxy server (reverse proxy). In addition to having a built-in "cache" management system as well as a web-based "cache" management system, the proxy is "modular" or "plugin-based." Web-based reporting and analytics using a graphical user interface (GUI) (GUI). By leveraging a custom-built content spinning engine, the system allows material to be "augmented" (or "spun") with little performance degradation (10,000+ thesaurus/dictionary entries) while maintaining high quality.

### Back-End

üç¶ The Dashboard interface communicates with a file-based database through PHP via JavaScript. Vanilla Dashboard is a freely downloadable and usable open source software. The Dashboard is a free and open-source project that wraps features like Vanilla, "Live Chat," and "Who Is Online" in a CSS-based user interface. The Dashboard may be downloaded for free from the Dashboard project's website.

## Use case / Applications

Create static flat file variants of your original webpages by using yxorp to mirror your websites and offer the mirrored/cloned copies as static flat file variations of the original webpages.

#### üî• Cache

When you use caching to load your websites, you may reduce loading time and server strain, resulting in websites that load faster.

#### üìõ Firewall

Create a virtual firewall to protect your websites behind your proxy server, giving security against website assaults such as DDOS attacks and other types of attacks.

#### üî≥ iFrame

It is possible to circumvent CORS for the iframing services that you need ‚Äì **not recommended, but feasible**.

#### üî± Load-balancing

This may be accomplished by deploying cloned copies of your website on various servers that are connected to a load-balancing system.

#### ‚åõ Allways-online

High/Continuous availability is achieved by running a proxy version of your existing website and switching to this version of the website during upgrades or down-time.

##### + many more..

There are several additional uses that may be explored, and these are only a few of the more common ones.

Diagnostic data from our mobile assistance, which has been regarded as the best-in-class in the industry, enables teams to reproduce and fix issues as soon as they begin to have an impact on system stability. Reports on error situations are arranged by root cause and may also be classified by business impact. In addition, they are supplied with extensive diagnostic information.

# Background Information

Two of the most powerful PHP reverse proxies now accessible on the internet have been merged to create a single web proxy that outperforms the two when their combined performance is considered. Please keep in mind that this is a brand-new project that may undergo changes in the future. With the php-proxy library, a component of the PHP programming language that is available for free download, you may quickly and easily configure a web proxy application for your web server. If you are able to contribute to or support this project, it would be much appreciated as it would enable me to devote more development time to it, therefore expediting its progress.

## Web-Proxy vs Proxy Server

Bear in mind that this proxy script may not function properly on websites or pages that are very script-heavy or include an excessive number of "dynamic components," as indicated above. Web proxies' inability to encrypt data is a well-documented flaw in the technology. When visiting such websites, you should utilize a legitimate proxy server to redirect your browser's HTTP requests via the following domains:

# The Dashboard

üç¶ The Dashboard component provides an application-specific JavaScript dashboard that connects with a PHP-written on-disk database adapted to the application's needs. Vanilla Dashboard, a free and open source program, may be downloaded from the internet. Numerous "Easter Eggs" are scattered around the Dashboard. The "Who Is Online," "Live Chat," and "Who Is Online" services, as well as a variety of other features, are all wrapped up in an easy-to-use CSS-based user interface that is available for download for free.

## Development Environment

A Liberating Dev Tool For All Your Projects LAMP recipe, which may be purchased from the link above, are required in order to complete the Lando - A Liberating Dev Tool For All Your Projects project. You may use the Lando - A Liberating Dev Tool For All Your Projects project for all of your projects since it enables you to either "plug and play" on PHP-compatible PCs or create in a LAMP environment. If you need any further information regarding this project, please visit the section under "Frequently Asked Questions." Worldwide, professional developers use local development and DevOps technologies on a daily basis, with the United States having the highest concentration of such technologies. In spite of the fact that there are insufficient instruments to assist in the development process, it is possible to transcend the conceptual limitations imposed by this situation. Concentrating your attention on the most important activities will allow you to save time, money, and frustration in the long run. Focusing your efforts on the most important tasks may help to alleviate some of the stress.

## Keep it up-to-date

When it comes to software updates, it is more often than not that they will be made to the application's dependant packages rather than the program itself; for example, most of the adjustments will be made to the php-proxy package rather than to the application itself.

#### .env

This file will be loaded into the Config class at the global level.

#### /plugins/

Users are encouraged to create their own unique plugins in this subdirectory, which will then be loaded automatically from the main directory. The proxy, which comes with a number of built-in plugins, is not without its limitations, and users are urged to create their own custom plugins in order to broaden the range of options available. Think of a simple example like the file /plugins/TestPlugin.php in the plugins directory as an illustration.

# Gitpod

Gitpod, a free and open-source Kubernetes program that is freely accessible on the internet, allows developers to quickly and efficiently set up code-ready development environments on their workstations. With the use of cloud-based technology, every piece of work accomplished leads in the production of new, automated development environments in the cloud, which are then accessible to other developers. It is only via the use of cloud computing that this is made feasible. The option to start immediate, remote, and cloud-based development environments regardless of whether your development environment is defined in code is available if you have a browser or desktop integrated development environment open on your computer.
